= EVE iPrice:  Item Pricer

Item Pricer is a script which will parse a list of items, ships, &c. and list their median selling prices as stated on EVE-Central.

== License

== Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with iPrice is to first download the prerequisite sqlite3 gem.

 $ sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

Once installed, the script can be run with the following

 $ ./ip

== Install

As stated, the only required library is for sqlite3.  The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.

== Usage

There are no arguments for this script, so the following is all that is needed.

 $ ./ip

You can then type a list of modules (one per line).  When you are done, press Ctrl+D and it will list the prices with respect to the order that the 
modules/ships/etc were typed.

An alternative is to type the list in a file and then pipe it in.

 $ cat list | ./ip
